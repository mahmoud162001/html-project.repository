    We examine the applicability of mobile software codes to perform networking tasks in wireless and mobile computing environments. We contend that the advent of wireless technologies during the past decade has turned computer networks increasingly complex to manage. In particular, factors such as context awareness and user mobility are now crucial in the design of communications protocols used by portable devices with moderate to severe bandwidth and battery power limitations. Unlike hard-coded communication protocols that fulfill a specific need, mobile software agents can be deployed to deal with a range of tasks and can be designed to efficiently adapt to diverse circumstances. We present our latest advancements in the areas of mobile ad hoc networking and wireless sensor networks using mobile agents (MAs). We also elaborate on the importance of engineering an efficient migration strategy as the single most distinctive proceeding that an MA performs to operate efficiently. In addition, we describe the Wiseman system for scripting MAs that can perform networking tasks in both homogeneous and heterogeneous wireless network environments. Monitoring, tracking, and E-healthcare applications are discussed and evaluated at length.

3.2.6 FREVO
FREVO [35] is an open source simulation tool. In [36], the authors propose to compute the best modulation schemes for fixed/mobile devices equipped with SDR capabilities by implementing a multi-objective and distributed neural/genetic algorithm. The objectives that nodes have to achieve are multiple and in some ways opposite, namely a better coverage of a specific sensing field and connectivity with a central node that plays the role of sink. In [36] the authors show the potential of mobile SDR communication sensors both from operation flexibility and dynamical reconfiguration. The use of the FREVO framework allowed the developing of a simulator for evolutionary design, and the strategy considered has been validated in different scenarios, by varying the number of nodes supporting the SDR capabilities and the number of nodes equipped with mobility capabilities. The use of SDR capabilities is envisaged as providing the possibility of forming self-evolving wireless networks able to support high data rate and connectivity in various communication scenarios. In Figure 5.6, we show a mobile node supporting SDR capabilities.
